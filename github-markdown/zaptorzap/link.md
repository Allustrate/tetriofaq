How-to link your Discord account to your TETR.IO account, primarily for TETR.IO Supporters

If you're interested in linking your Discord account to your TETR.IO account, navigate to CONFIG > ACCOUNT > CONNECTIONS, as detailed in this video: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/865065775760408597/supporterlink.mp4

This link is currently used to grant the <@&691017651203473490> role to TETR.IO supporters, and to provide account verification for the Character System playtester application form. If you have recently purchased or been gifted supporter, you shouldn't have to wait too long before the role is automatically given to you, so long as the <@688741895307788290> bot is online. If you're having trouble linking your account, and are using TETR.IO Desktop, try linking from the website version instead, as this is less prone to error.
