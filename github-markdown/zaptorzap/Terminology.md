The TETR.IO community, like any community, has several "inside phrases" other new users may not be informed of. The list that follows is likely incomplete, but it covers the most common terms you might not otherwise understand.

## Ingame symbolism
Often times, built right into the game itself, TETR.IO demonstrates forms of nondescriptive symbolism around the UI. Here's some definitions surrounding those.

### Zen Levels

ZEN levels are usually accompanied by little symbols around TETR.IO. These symbols represent the numerical ZEN level in modified roman numerals. Here's a graphic detailing them all ---->

Once the maximum numeral has been attained, which is unlikely to happen as [the closest player](https://ch.tetr.io/u/blb) is still 490,605 levels off of that goal, it will loop for infinity.

### Network icons
Depending on the active internet connection, several network icons may flash on the left side of the screen indicating various different active issues with the current connection. Here's a chart listing them all and their descriptions:

If you would like to permanently remove these symbols, you may do so by enabling "HIDE NETWORK WARNING ICONS" under "VIDEO & INTERFACE" in the "CONFIG".

## Common terms
The TETR.IO community has established several terms to refer to different types of strategies and gameplay, the sort of which can only be sustained in a delayless stacker such as TETR.IO. Here's a jumpstart to some of these terms. 

### "Plonker"
"Plonking" refers to the act of **intentionally tanking garbage lines**, sometimes *noticeably slowing down or stalling to do so*, in order to send reverse-spikes fueled by an enemy's garbage. This garbage abuse is made possible thanks to TETR.IO's "change-on-attack" garbage generation, guaranteeing each line from an individual attack generates in a singular, consistent column, as decided by RNG. A "plonker" may be vaguely defined by a given user's high VS:PPS ratio.(one staple of VS Score involves its factoring of garbage lines cleared - this is why VS score is considered over raw APM) In effect, a plonker is the opposite of a strider: **plonkers play matches slowly, pay close attention to incoming garbage, and keep a low field.**

### "Strider"
Originally a Jstris meme requiring an incredibly specific 40 LINES sprint time (one under 26.179 seconds), your inability to "be a pepegon", a versus skill which must be disproportionate to your sprint time, the ability to "hit the stride", and optionally the display of the ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡² flag on your profile;
*a strider in today's terminology is used to vaguely define players based on their high PPS:APM ratio.* To shorten this down a little: **a strider typically plays fast and inefficient,** essentially existing only in delayless games such as TETR.IO. "stride" and "strider" are normally used interchangeably, with "striding" usually being the temporal verb to describe any player's gameplay for a given match/round/replay as fast and inefficient.
