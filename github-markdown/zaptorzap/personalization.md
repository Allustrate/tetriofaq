# Profile Customization
Registered users can customize their ingame appearance through a variety of ways, both paid and unpaid. Here's some common missteps people fall in:

## Registration
Welcome to TETR.IO! While you can play with a far less involved "anonymous" account,(see below for details) a fully registered account is your only ticket into the TETRA LEAGUE, saved 40 LINES and BLITZ records, access to a customizable profile card and userpage(such as profile pictures: refer to FAQ entry below), and more!

**__To create a TETR.IO account__**, first, navigate to https://tetr.io/. You will be greeted with the registration dialog immediately, provided you aren't already logged in(1). From here, 
1. enter your chosen username(1.1) and click the JOIN button(1.2). 
2. **If the username is taken, you will be prompted for its password(2)**: in this case, back out and choose another username(2.1). 
3. If the username is unoccupied, you will be prompted to either "STAY ANONYMOUS" or "REGISTER"(3). 
4. After selecting REGISTER, you will be asked to supply an optional email, as well as the password you will lock your account with(4).

Please note that you are only allowed one registered account as per the alt policy found at <https://tetr.io/about/rules/>! Choose your name wisely: future name changes are only available with the purchase of TETR.IO supporter.

### Logging Into Your Account
Logging into your registered account is easy, if not slightly obscure. The registration form doubles as a login questionnaire, so, if you know your username and password, just follow these steps!

1. When prompted to "ENTER A USERNAME TO JOIN"(1), enter in your registered account's username(1.1) and choose JOIN(1.2).
2. You'll see a section(2) asking for your password at this stage(2.1), enter that in and click LOGIN(2.2). That's it!
#### Resetting a Password
If you've forgotten your password, click I FORGOT(2.3). You'll be brought to an extra question asking you for the email tied to this account(3). Ensure you enter your email **exactly as you entered it while registering!** Case sensitivity doesn't matter, but do try a couple different emails before throwing in the "i musta not entered an email" hat!

### Anonymous Registration
While impeded by several limitations, "anonymous" accounts are integral to TETR.IO's original concept of being "about as easy to join as a standard .IO game". They're also normally exempt from [the alt policy](https://tetr.io/about/rules/#ap), so you could have an secondary anonymous account as a registered user for controller play, for instance. All you need to make one is a *single* click on the JOIN button, if you don't mind having a non-descriptive username. Anonymous accounts *can* have customized usernames however, provided the username isn't already used by a registered account:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897051673556582420/registeranon.png)

1. Simply enter a username(1.1) into the prompt you see while not logged into <https://tetr.io/>(1), then click JOIN(1.2).
2. **If the username you chose is already in use,** you'll be prompted for whoever owns that account's password(2). Please proceed to back out of this login attempt(2.1).
3. If the chosen username is free, simply click STAY ANONYMOUS to keep the username in an anonymous state(3)!

## Profile Pictures
Registered TETR.IO user accounts may set their profile pictures for free from the relevant account settings category. The attached video shows you how to access this category, available from the ingame CONFIG option:

# Custom Assets
Looking to add your own backgrounds/skins to the game? Here's how to do it!

## Built-in Backgrounds
**Q:** How do I set a custom background?

**A:** Assuming you have a local file on your computer you'd like to use, just upload that file to **[catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/)**. As of writing, it's free for use and simply works with TETR.IO's CORS header-requirements. 

### Troubleshooting
If your image is already hosted on the net*(Catbox included)*, and you have a *(nonfunctional ingame)* link to use with TETR.IO's ingame background option, consider debugging that link with [this interactive checker](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrio/backgrounds/).
If this site is showing that the link *should work*, please proceed to hard-reload the game with **CTRL+F5** *(yes, even on the desktop client)*. After this point, navigate into a SOLO 40 LINES match to confirm the background loading.

## Custom Skins
**Q:** Where do you get custom skins from?

**A:** Custom blockskins are generally discovered through the
* [you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus/) repository of skins
* [Curated gallery on Tenchi's site](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=skins)
* [Jstris Customization Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xO8DTORacMmSJAQicpJscob7WUkOVuaNH0wzkR_X194/edit#gid=1212216734)
* As all outlined in [this wiki page dedicated to finding content](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/finding-content)

You'll want to load these with the third party TETR.IO PLUS addon, exclusive to [the TETR.IO Desktop app](https://tetr.io/about/desktop/) or the Firefox web browser.

TETR.IO PLUS's project page, as well as __downloads for the modification__, may be found [here](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/home "TETR.IO PLUS's GitLab repository's wiki").

# Stock Assets
Interested in getting a copy of TETR.IO's default assets? Here's where you get that!

## Music

*TETR.IO's* soundtrack is currently entirely provided by various musicians under the royalty free [*HURT RECORD* label](<https://www.hurtrecord.com/>) -- that is to say, each soundtrack *should* be stream-safe, provided you show the onscreen watermark centered near the bottom, displaying the currently playing 
song during the very start of gameplay. *Refer to [HURT RECORD's terms of service](https://www.hurtrecord.com/about/terms.html) for specific terms of use.*

Interested in listening to or downloading the soundtrack for personal use? There's [a YouTube mirror here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFmyK0hSlVD_a98eL1BcGMOTblz8kQ0h) as well as [an up-to-date Google Sheets list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_tpfLo_qUfNG2vQG3uqQ5fbjT01VefZVgB7RH2lOzM/edit), *both provided by EricICX.*

## Fonts
Here's a list of all of TETR.IO's fonts, as well as where you can download them and install them. Just right click these files in the File Explorer to do that.
* HUN-din: https://tetr.io/res/font/hun2.ttf?v=9
* ProFontWindows: https://tetr.io/res/font/pfw.ttf
* Config: https://tetr.io/res/font/cr.ttf:

## Sound Effects
All of TETR.IO's sound effects are stored in a single "sound effect atlas" found [here](https://tetr.io/sfx/tetrio.ogg). There's an issue with this file though; all sound effects are split only by time and not by file names, so it's likely this file isn't the one you want. If you would like a copy of all of the TETR.IO sounds split up, *albeit with an ever so slightly lower quality,* please download [this `.zip` file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/919778936475508776/tetrio-sound-effects.zip).
