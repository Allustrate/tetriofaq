Welcome to some of TETR.IO's Frequently Asked Questions! First pioneered with the aid of Discord user Tenchi and [his initial request for one on the official TETR.IO Discord server](https://github.com/tetrio/issues/issues/241), the various FAQs available expanded in scope drastically. 

# Other Resources
Of course, this FAQ cannot hope to answer every question on its own(although we do accept contributions, read on), so if something in here doesn't answer your question, check these other resources I, ZaptorZap, frequently link to:
* [Tenchi's TETR.IO STATS' FAQ](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq)
* [The official TETR.IO Discord](https://l.tetr.io/discord)'s "bb" bot and its [related FAQ thread](https://discord.com/channels/673303546107658242/898101282009657364)(of which I cite most of my writing from)

And some other more general resources I'll link to even in this FAQ later on:
* [The Tetris Wiki](https://tetris.wiki/), particularly its articles on [TETR.IO](https://tetris.wiki/TETR.IO) or [TETR.IO Badges](https://tetris.wiki/TETR.IO_Badges)
* [four.lol](https://four.lol/), and particularly its accurate search engine
* [The Hard Drop Wiki](https://harddrop.com/) beats out these two with mass alone, but mass comes at a quality cut.

# Contributing
Well, I didn't just make this open source because I *absolutely had* to. I'm accepting contributions from you, the reader, if you have good ideas or the good writing to make them happen for me. Contributing's a piece of cake, even if you don't have a Github account.

<details>
<summary>Contribution information</summary>

## Contributing made easy (for you)
As of writing, I believe the chances are greater than 70% that you're here because someone directly led you here. If that someone happens to be the maintainer of this project, and you have ideas for it, be it a new question, or errors contained in the various texts, perhaps let him know directly by doing what all users uncontrollably do: asking questions **frequently.** Of course, you're advised to ensure your question isn't already answered by a slightly more extensive search of this FAQ, or the many other directly linked pages, first.

Simple prompts coming my way work well, but txt documents supporting Github flavored `m`ark`d`own are just as easily integrated. As of now, attribution happens through named folders within the repository itself, so I can define arbitraty usernames without hassle. If you do happen to have a Github account, though...

## Contributing made slightly harder
By far the best way to attribute to yourself, and make things a bit less of a hassle on my end, would be following the standard proceedure for code additions to any Github: forking the project, adding your Github flavored `.md` files to a folder named after none other than yourself, and then submitting a pull request with myself at the main branch.

From there, your submission will go through minimal classification to try and slot it in with the rest of the FAQs naturally, as well as some tense peer review for quality control regarding grammar, formatting, and continuity.(I'm gonna be honest with you, I hold this kind of writing to a high standard and get really defensive when it gets edited) If it's all good, I should have it up on the main wiki within the day you submit your pull request.(no warranties attached, though...)
