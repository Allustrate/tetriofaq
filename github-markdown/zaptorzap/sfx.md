All sound effects used in TETR.IO

All of TETR.IO's sound effects are stored in a single "sound effect atlas" found here: <https://tetr.io/sfx/tetrio.ogg>. Issue is, all sound effects are split only by time and not by file names, so it's likely this file isn't the one you want. If you would like a copy of all of the TETR.IO sounds split up, albeit with an ever so slightly lower quality, please download this `.zip` file: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/919778936475508776/tetrio-sound-effects.zip>.
