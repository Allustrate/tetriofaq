How-to create an __anonymous__ TETR.IO account, as well as an explanation on what one is

While impeded by several limitations, "anonymous" accounts are integral to TETR.IO's original concept of being "about as easy to join as a standard .IO game". They're also normally exempt from the alt policy found at <https://tetr.io/about/rules/>, so you could have an secondary anonymous account as a registered user for controller play, for instance. All you need to make one is a *single* click on the JOIN button, if you don't mind having a non-descriptive username. Anonymous accounts *can* have customized usernames however, provided the username isn't already used by a registered account:

Simply enter a username(1.1) into the prompt you see while not logged into <https://tetr.io/>(1), then click JOIN(1.2).
**If the username you chose is already in use,** you'll be prompted for whoever owns that account's password(2). Please proceed to back out of this login attempt(2.1).
If the chosen username is free, simply click STAY ANONYMOUS to keep the username in an anonymous state(3)!
