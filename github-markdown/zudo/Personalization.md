## Tiers of Supporter

[TETR.IO Supporter](https://l.tetr.io) tiers are determined by your amount of **total** support - including purchases for yourself, gifts you've sent to other players, and any Patreon support from the old supporter system. You can check this number by going to CONFIG > ACCOUNT.

The cutoffs for each supporter tier are as follows:

  -  ★ (tier 2) - 20€
  -  ★★ (tier 3) - 80€
  -  ★★★ (tier 4) - 250€

Once you've achieved a supporter tier, you keep it forever. If your supporter expires, the supporter tier badge and name colour will be hidden, but will be reactivated if you purchase (or are gifted) more supporter.

Furthermore, your name will be permanently listed in the game's credits when you reach 200€ of total support. Unlike other supporter benefits, this will remain even if your supporter expires.
