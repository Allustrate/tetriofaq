# Personalization
This section goes over some of the confusing aspects users run into while customizing their account or game visuals.

## Profile Customization
Registered users can customize their ingame appearance through a variety of ways, both paid and unpaid. Here's some common missteps people fall in:

### Registration
Welcome to TETR.IO! While you can play with a far less involved "anonymous" account,(see below for details) a fully registered account is your only ticket into the TETRA LEAGUE, saved 40 LINES and BLITZ records, access to a customizable profile card and userpage(such as profile pictures: refer to FAQ entry below), and more!

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897041837213224980/register.png)

**__To create a TETR.IO account__**, first, navigate to https://tetr.io/. You will be greeted with the registration dialog immediately, provided you aren't already logged in(1). From here, 
1. enter your chosen username(1.1) and click the JOIN button(1.2). 
2. **If the username is taken, you will be prompted for its password(2)**: in this case, back out and choose another username(2.1). 
3. If the username is unoccupied, you will be prompted to either "STAY ANONYMOUS" or "REGISTER"(3). 
4. After selecting REGISTER, you will be asked to supply an optional email, as well as the password you will lock your account with(4).

Please note that you are only allowed one registered account as per the alt policy found at <https://tetr.io/about/rules/>! Choose your name wisely: future name changes are only available with the purchase of TETR.IO supporter.

#### Logging Into Your Account
Logging into your registered account is easy, if not slightly obscure. The registration form doubles as a login questionnaire, so, if you know your username and password, just follow these steps!

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897061029782102026/register.png)

1. When prompted to "ENTER A USERNAME TO JOIN"(1), enter in your registered account's username(1.1) and choose JOIN(1.2).
2. You'll see a section(2) asking for your password at this stage(2.1), enter that in and click LOGIN(2.2). That's it!
##### Resetting a Password
If you've forgotten your password, click I FORGOT(2.3). You'll be brought to an extra question asking you for the email tied to this account(3). Ensure you enter your email **exactly as you entered it while registering!** Case sensitivity doesn't matter, but do try a couple different emails before throwing in the "i musta not entered an email" hat!

#### Anonymous Registration
While impeded by several limitations, "anonymous" accounts are integral to TETR.IO's original concept of being "about as easy to join as a standard .IO game". They're also normally exempt from [the alt policy](https://tetr.io/about/rules/#ap), so you could have an secondary anonymous account as a registered user for controller play, for instance. All you need to make one is a *single* click on the JOIN button, if you don't mind having a non-descriptive username. Anonymous accounts *can* have customized usernames however, provided the username isn't already used by a registered account:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897051673556582420/registeranon.png)

1. Simply enter a username(1.1) into the prompt you see while not logged into <https://tetr.io/>(1), then click JOIN(1.2).
2. **If the username you chose is already in use,** you'll be prompted for whoever owns that account's password(2). Please proceed to back out of this login attempt(2.1).
3. If the chosen username is free, simply click STAY ANONYMOUS to keep the username in an anonymous state(3)!

### Profile Pictures
Registered TETR.IO user accounts may set their profile pictures for free from the relevant account settings category. The attached video shows you how to access this category, available from the ingame CONFIG option:

## Custom Assets
Looking to add your own backgrounds/skins to the game? Here's how to do it!

### Built-in Backgrounds
**Q:** How do I set a custom background?

**A:** Assuming you have a local file on your computer you'd like to use, just upload that file to **[catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/)**. As of writing, it's free for use and simply works with TETR.IO's CORS header-requirements. 

#### Troubleshooting
If your image is already hosted on the net*(Catbox included)*, and you have a *(nonfunctional ingame)* link to use with TETR.IO's ingame background option, consider debugging that link with [this interactive checker](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrio/backgrounds/).
If this site is showing that the link *should work*, please proceed to hard-reload the game with **CTRL+F5** *(yes, even on the desktop client)*. After this point, navigate into a SOLO 40 LINES match to confirm the background loading.

### Custom Skins
**Q:** Where do you get custom skins from?

**A:** Custom blockskins are generally discovered through the
* [you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus/) repository of skins
* [Curated gallery on Tenchi's site](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=skins)
* [Jstris Customization Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xO8DTORacMmSJAQicpJscob7WUkOVuaNH0wzkR_X194/edit#gid=1212216734)
* As all outlined in [this wiki page dedicated to finding content](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/finding-content)

You'll want to load these with the third party TETR.IO PLUS addon, exclusive to [the TETR.IO Desktop app](https://tetr.io/about/desktop/) or the Firefox web browser.

TETR.IO PLUS's project page, as well as __downloads for the modification__, may be found [here](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/home "TETR.IO PLUS's GitLab repository's wiki").

## Stock Assets
Interested in getting a copy of TETR.IO's default assets? Here's where you get that!

### Music

*TETR.IO's* soundtrack is currently entirely provided by various musicians under the royalty free [*HURT RECORD* label](<https://www.hurtrecord.com/>) -- that is to say, each soundtrack *should* be stream-safe, provided you show the onscreen watermark centered near the bottom, displaying the currently playing 
song during the very start of gameplay. *Refer to [HURT RECORD's terms of service](https://www.hurtrecord.com/about/terms.html) for specific terms of use.*

Interested in listening to or downloading the soundtrack for personal use? There's [a YouTube mirror here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFmyK0hSlVD_a98eL1BcGMOTblz8kQ0h) as well as [an up-to-date Google Sheets list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_tpfLo_qUfNG2vQG3uqQ5fbjT01VefZVgB7RH2lOzM/edit), *both provided by EricICX.*

### Fonts
Here's a list of all of TETR.IO's fonts, as well as where you can download them and install them. Just right click these files in the File Explorer to do that.
* HUN-din: https://tetr.io/res/font/hun2.ttf?v=9
* ProFontWindows: https://tetr.io/res/font/pfw.ttf
* Config: https://tetr.io/res/font/cr.ttf: 
* Franklin Gothic already comes with Windows, though you're specifically looking for Franklin Gothic Medium

### Sound Effects
All of TETR.IO's sound effects are stored in a single "sound effect atlas" found [here](https://tetr.io/sfx/tetrio.ogg). There's an issue with this file though; all sound effects are split only by time and not by file names, so it's likely this file isn't the one you want. If you would like a copy of all of the TETR.IO sounds split up, *albeit with an ever so slightly lower quality,* please download [this `.zip` file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/919778936475508776/tetrio-sound-effects.zip).

# Mechanics
This section goes over some of the less understood mechanics surrounding TETR.IO.

## In general
### Fire
The "fire bar" effect triggers when you build up enough "fire points" to cause it. You can accumulate fire points by clearing a large spike, keeping a large back to back chain up, or, by koing people (koing people is the most effective way to build fire points.). You also steal fire points from the people you've ko'd; you can see how filled your ko'd user's fire bar was by looking at the little percentage sign next to their name. This whole system is entirely cosmetic, and can be disabled from the settings.

### Character System
First revealed in mid-November 2020 and developed since, the prototyped "Character System" is planned to be TETR.IO's "Beta" feature.
* For Character System conversation, please check out the *#Official Character System Thread* in [the TETR.IO Discord server](https://l.tetr.io/discord). It forks off from #lobby.
* Otherwise, [this supplementary FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gRX1lorozF2NeJqgdkGyqrqkD-dD0wjYRimNQHGPj0w/edit) created by [TwoQuantumBits](https://2qb.carrd.co/ "TwoQuantumBits's webpage") may be of use.
* The above links to [this in-depth up-to-date documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjoLa3cXIp9vhmNoadk2PWRyFHFnYlOfnavs3Ga2gis/edit#gid=353436719) created by [SigmaZero](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Qal7IJul-6iC3YvYZ4Q1A "SigmaZero's linked YouTube page") on the system.
* If you're still skeptical to the validity of these pages, [here's documentation by osk himself](https://characters.osk.sh/). **Please note that this documentation is wildly out of date!**

## TETRA LEAGUE
TETRA LEAGUE is TETR.IO's premier matchmaking system featured for free for all registered accounts above level 10. While gameplay is very straightforward, 1v1 against another player of similar skill, the exact mechanics behind what the various mechanical values are and how the system itself works are often pondered.
*also see:*
* Tenchi's FAQ on 
1. [how the game decides what rank you are](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#decide-rank)
2. [being unranked after playing ten placement matches](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#placement)
3. [matchmaking with players far from your TR](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#rank-match)
4. [inconsistent ranks](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#inconsistent-ranks)
and likely many more

### Rating Deviation
RD is the number *after* the **±** symbol in your Glicko rating value. "RD" stands for **R**ating **D**eviation. It is a measurement of "How uncertain the Glicko-2 system is of your rating. Lower is better." (according to ingame hover text)

RD *generally* goes down after playing a match. It is possible to *gain* RD after a match, however. RD limits itself to a value of "60", according to osk, however, some players have  even attained 58 RD. The upper limit of RD is 349, after which, RD will be unable to go any further.

RD accumulates at a static rate of "1 RD per day, after a week of inactivity." You can tell whether or not your RD is currently "decaying" by navigating to your TETRA CHANNEL Userpage, found at `https://ch.tetr.io/u/your-username-here` and viewing the Glicko number, looking for an arrow which points in this direction: ↗️

### Rank Cutoffs
Interested in seeing the TETR.IO rank requirements? You may attain this information from [Tenchi's dynamic "TETR.IO STATS" project](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=ranks), however, do note rank cutoffs are very volatile, and that this site only updates at a rate of once per every 6 hours, so this site does **__not__** host up-to-date or official information!

For some aforementioned up-to-date official information, feel free to visit your TETRA CHANNEL userpage found at `https://ch.tetr.io/u/your-username-here` and inspect the TETRA LEAGUE section. While only vaguely stated, and only shown if ranked, a "progress bar" will be shown below your stats, indicating your global placement, the placement required to reach the next rank, and the placement required to *keep your current rank.*

## Handling
Handling controls how your pieces interact with your sustained input to any of the movement keys. They have a dedicated section in the titular HANDLING section of the ingame CONFIG. Below are some short descriptions of these values.
*also see:*
* [25Pi25's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKQZdRu6_g0 "How to properly set your TETR.IO Handling!") summarizing how to set your handling.
* [This instinctual `.gif` file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813901028394795078/871859207605985300/DAS_and_ARR.gif) everyone keeps sharing to which I cannot attribute to anyone at this point.

### Auto Repeat Rate
__[A]__uto __[R]__epeat __[R]__ate(lower is faster: 0 is instantaneous): This slider controls how quickly pieces move around while holding the left or right movement keys. It's well known that an "optimal" ARR is 0: when ARR is this value, pieces teleport instantly upon DAS charge, allowing for extremely fast play. Good [finesse](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#finesse "Tenchi's FAQ on finesse") is a must-have if using this handling, however!

### Delayed Auto Shift
__[D]__elayed __[A]__uto __[S]__hift(lower is faster): This slider controls how long you hold the left or right movement keys before engaging ARR. To put it simply: 
* DAS is how long you hold L/R before the piece goes brrrr
* ARR is how *quickly* the piece goes brrrr. 

Optimal DAS values largely differ from player to player, so experiment around with different ones! *(hint: you may test your current handling settings from the TEST button in the top right of the HANDLING section)*

### ﻿DAS Cut Delay
__﻿[D]﻿__AS __﻿[C]﻿__ut __﻿[D]﻿__elay(higher is slower: 0 disables the system): An experimental and complicated handling setting, DAS Cut Delay hasn't seen much use in professional play. DAS Cut Delay introduces a set of pauses to active DAS, every time one of the two following actions occur:
1. A piece is rotated: 

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/775479818942021672/2020-11-09_22-59-41.mp4

2. A piece is spawned: 

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/775480550471237702/2020-11-09_23-02-29.mp4

If either of these actions occur, **﻿DAS is "paused"﻿**, or "cut" for the amount of frames DCD is configured to. It primarily targets 0ARR play, and aims to make certain finesse moves possible while keeping DAS charged, as well as reducing possible misdrops. 
[➔ A common value for it would be around 1 or 2 frames.](https://tetr.io/about/patchnotes/#chlog_5_0_0﻿)

### Soft Drop Factor
__[S]__oft __[D]__rop __[F]__actor(higher is faster: ♾️ is instantaneous): This slider controlshow quickly your piece will soft drop, given you are holding the soft drop key. It doesn't necessarily multiply current gravity, as you can still soft drop in zero gravity.(0 times anything, even infinity, equals 0)
An optimal value for this would be ♾️, as stacks that require partial soft drops to tuck pieces in is just *not a good stack.* If this functionality is a dealbreaker for you, limiting yourself to 20X or lower, then you have bigger issues to worry about.

#### Sonic Drop
To execute a "hard drop without placing the piece", such as those extremely fast T-Spins, turn this slider in the CONFIG to ♾️! Then, use your soft drop key as normal: the piece will rocket down to the bottom instantly now!

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897711015981113404/unknown.png)

## Super Rotation System
"SRS", or, as this anagram expands to, "**[S]**uper **[R]**otation **[S]**ystem", is the driving force behind how the game handles rotations that intersect the stack. This system has some seemingly inconsistent and unconventional behaviors, especially for certain tucks, so here's some illustrations on such spins.
*also see:*
* The Tetris Wiki on
1. [TETR.IO's 180 kicks](https://tetris.wiki/TETR.IO#180_Kicks)
2. [SRS+](https://tetris.wiki/TETR.IO#SRS.2B)
3. [SRS in general](https://tetris.wiki/Super_Rotation_System)
* [The Hard Drop Wiki on SRS](https://harddrop.com/wiki/SRS)

## ZS Spins
Z and S tucks can be confusing to new players, since they rely on impulsively developed rotation systems which carry somewhat unconventional definitions of symmetry; this system, known as SRS, is likely why you're failing to execute successful Z or S spins.

**To execute a wall-less Z spin**, starting from the spawn position, press the __counter clockwise__ rotation key, then soft drop and press the __counter clockwise__ rotation key once more: (here's an easy way to remember this, assuming you have the default guideline controls: press the **"z"** key twice to **z** spin)
If there is any walls spanning across both sides, as shown in the second half of this gif, simply reverse the rotations and *press the neutral __clockwise__ rotation key twice*, instead.

**To execute a wall-less S spin**, starting from the spawn position, press the __clockwise__ rotation key, soft drop, and press the __clockwise__ rotation key once again: (many new players default to *only* rotating clockwise, as the only feasible key to rotate is the up arrow key, next to all other movement keys. This is why S spins may appear "easier" to a new user.)
Assuming two walls exists, such as the one shown in the second half of this gif, simply reverse the rotations and *press the opposite __counter clockwise__ rotation key twice*, instead.

## /set Command Usage
The ingame `/set` command has plenty of valid use case scenarios, but at the end of the day, it still is what you make out of it. That said, here's a bunch of reference to make the most out of this command, without straining your hands typing a preset out manually!
### Automatic Solutions:
First, we'll go over automated solutions, from least intrusive to most:
* [Zudo](https://kagar.in/ "Zudo's homepage")'s [Autohost project](https://gitlab.com/Zudo/autohost/ "Source repository -- unrecommended for casual users") includes several commands for room presets. Please refer to this [ingame bot](https://ch.tetr.io/u/autohost)'s [documentation to get started](https://gitlab.com/Zudo/autohost/-/wikis/Get-Started). Once you have your room configured the way you like, use the command `!savepreset <name>`  to save it as a preset. You can then load the settings in the future with `!preset <name>`, or delete them with `!delpreset <name>`. There are a handful of built-in presets that you can view by simply running `!preset`.
* [Zutatensuppe](https://github.com/Zutatensuppe "Zutatensuppe's Github profile")'s custom JavaScript bookmarklet: a quick how-to guide is included both [here](https://github.com/Zutatensuppe/tetrio-preset) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetris/comments/r3o5w3/preset_tool_for_custom_multiplayer_room_settings/), alongside source code for the bookmarklet itself.
* [aznguy.mp4](http://aznguy.com/ "aznguy.mp4's homepage")'s console solution: paste the following code into your browser's devtools, accessible by using `F12` in most scenarios(including TETR.IO desktop), to dump your current room's properties into the console. This is a bit of a blunt solution, and it will include lots of extra definitions that would otherwise be assumed(as default settings), so only use this as an inbetween while creating `/set` presets from scratch!
```js
var configs = document.getElementsByClassName("room_config_item")
var cmd = '/set '

for(let i = 0; i<configs.length; i++) {
    var v = configs[i]
    var datIdx = v.getAttribute('data-index')
    if(datIdx&&datIdx.match(/.{4}./)) {
        cmd+=${datIdx}=${v.value=='on'?v.checked+0:v.value};\

    }
}
console.log(cmd)
```

### Manual reference
Here's some pointers if you'd like to avoid the automated solutions and instead create your own:
* [aznguy.mp4](http://aznguy.com/ "aznguy.mp4's homepage")'s list of `/set` attributes: as pinned in #tetrio on the official TETR.IO Discord server, it's also available [on Tenchi's FAQ](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=faq#commands).
* [ZaptorZap](https://github.com/ZaptorZap/tetriofaq "ZaptorZap's github profile")'s `.txt` file of complete `/set` presets: it's always nice to learn by example, so here's a five for one deal! Download it [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/763146093655359488/917684858099232798/tetrio_multiplayer_rule_presets.txt) (if you have suggestions for new presets, feel free to direct message ZaptorZap#0405 about them!)
As well as these resources, here's some more specific advice: note that `/set` presets **are bound by TETR.IO's 513 character chat limit**. If a `/set` preset calls for more than this limit, either split it up into two halves or try to truncate defaults settings out.
