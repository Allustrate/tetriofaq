Once you have your room configured the way you like, use the command `!savepreset <name>`  to save it as a preset. You can then load the settings in the future with `!preset <name>`, or delete them with `!delpreset <name>`. There are a handful of built-in presets that you can view by simply running `!preset`.\n - Zutatensuppe's custom JavaScript bookmarklet: a quick how-to guide is included in <https://github.com/Zutatensuppe/tetrio-preset> and <https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetris/comments/r3o5w3/preset_tool_for_custom_multiplayer_room_settings/>\n - <@616498515106988073>'s console solution: paste the following code into your browser's devtools, accessible by using `F12` in most scenarios(incl TETR.IO desktop), to dump your current room's properties into the console.

The first would be simply connecting any conventional controller through bluetooth or usb, and binding that controller in TETR.IO's config natively(see FAQ `controller`). \nThe second workaround involves using what's known as a \"bookmarklet\", which is basically JavaScript code you run from a bookmark, to create __onscreen touch controls__.
