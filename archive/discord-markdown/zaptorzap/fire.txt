Information on the "fire bar"; __the reason usernames in quick play invert__

The "fire bar" effect triggers when you build up enough "fire points" to cause it. You can accumulate fire points by clearing a large spike, keeping a large back to back chain up, or, by koing people (koing people is the most effective way to build fire points.). You also steal fire points from the people you've ko'd; you can see how filled your ko'd user's fire bar was by looking at the little percentage sign next to their name. This whole system is entirely cosmetic, and can be disabled from the settings.
