Can you play TETR.IO on mobile devices?

TETR.IO will never officially support mobile devices:

That being said, there are ways to **play TETR.IO on your phone**! Here's one quick rule, though: it **cannot be any iOS-based Apple device.** This is __absolute__, TETR.IO simply will not load under WebKit(<https://github.com/tetrio/issues/issues/425>). Otherwise, you're welcome to try with any android device, but compatibility is *not* guaranteed as these are unsupported platforms!

To load TETR.IO on mobile, just visit <https://tetr.io/> on your mobile browser of choice. *That's it!* The real problem arises when you attempt to *control the game,* so there's a couple of different attacks you can use. The first would be simply connecting any conventional controller through bluetooth or usb, and binding that controller in TETR.IO's config natively(see FAQ `controller`). 
The second workaround involves using what's known as a "bookmarklet", which is basically JavaScript code you run from a bookmark, to create __onscreen touch controls__. A specialized site to generate these bookmarklets may be found **here: https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrio/touchcontrols/**. There's included instructions in this site once you've defined your controls.
