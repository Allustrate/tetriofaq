Performance related how-to guide: make TETR.IO use your __d__edicated __g__raphics __p__rocessor __u__nit

Are you using a laptop and getting poor performance with TETR.IO Desktop or browsers? If so, you'll want to ensure Windows is using your "dedicated" graphics card, as opposed to the less performant, yet more power efficient "integrated" graphics card Windows is likely selecting for you. You can override this autoselection by following this lengthy image guide: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673305614318960671/851893786707230720/unknown.png
If you use TETR.IO Desktop, ||then you will find the executable in `%localappdata%\\Programs\\tetrio-desktop\\resources`||
If you use Chrome, ||you may find it in `%programfiles%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`, `%programfiles(x86)%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`, or `%localappdata%\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe`||
And, if you're a Firefox kinda guy, ||then you will find Firefox's executable in `%programfiles(x86)%\\Mozilla Firefox\\` or `%programfiles%\\Mozilla Firefox\\`, depending on which architecture (32 or 64 bits respectively) your computer currently has installed||
