How do I use a controller?

TETR.IO includes full controller support, even including vibrations for different actions, be it from your browser, or from the official TETR.IO Desktop client. Just connect your controller of choice and bind it manually in the ingame config: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/790555690317774868/21_122535.mp4
If your controller isn't working, here's a couple of different pointers to direct your attention towards:
     - First off, ensure any D/XInput redirection isn't active. **This includes software like Steam or JoyToKey.**
     - Ensure the controller you're attempting to use is **the only controller connected.** TETR.IO only accepts input from so-called "port one", though, there are plans to remedy this issue. If you had other controllers plugged in, a __restart__ of the pc may be required.
If neither of these troubleshooting steps work, here's some specialized software for specific controllers:
**PS4/PS5's DualShock** lineup: use DS4Windows <https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/releases/tag/v3.0.18>
**Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con or Pro Controller** controllers: use BetterJoy's "ShowAsXInput" function <https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy/releases>
