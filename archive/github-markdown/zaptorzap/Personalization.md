This section largely goes over some of the confusing aspects users run into while customizing their account or game visuals.

# Profile Customization
Registered users can customize their ingame appearance through a variety of ways, both paid and unpaid. Here's some common missteps people fall in:

## Registration
<img align="right" width="369" height="450" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897041837213224980/register.png">

Welcome to TETR.IO! While you can play with a far less involved "anonymous" account,(see below for details) a fully registered account is your only ticket into the TETRA LEAGUE, saved 40 LINES and BLITZ records, access to a customizable profile card and userpage(such as profile pictures: refer to FAQ entry below), and more!

**To create a TETR.IO account**, first, navigate to https://tetr.io/. You will be greeted with the registration dialog immediately, provided you aren't already logged in(1). From here, 
1. enter your chosen username(1.1) and click the JOIN button(1.2). 
2. **If the username is taken, you will be prompted for its password(2)**: in this case, back out and choose another username(2.1). 
3. If the username is unoccupied, you will be prompted to either "STAY ANONYMOUS" or "REGISTER"(3). 
4. After selecting REGISTER, you will be asked to supply an optional email, as well as the password you will lock your account with(4).

Please note that you are only allowed one registered account as per the alt policy found at <https://tetr.io/about/rules/>! Choose your name wisely: future name changes are only available with the purchase of TETR.IO supporter.

### Logging Into Your Account
<img align="right" width="369" height="332" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897061029782102026/register.png"> <!-- this causes some really horrible rendering with the wiki editor's preview, but the preview seems to have like double the width, so i think it'll work as a live page -->

Logging into your registered account is easy, if not slightly obscure. The registration form doubles as a login questionnaire, so, if you know your username and password, just follow these steps!

1. When prompted to "ENTER A USERNAME TO JOIN"(1), enter in your registered account's username(1.1) and choose JOIN(1.2).
2. You'll see a section(2) asking for your password at this stage(2.1), enter that in and click LOGIN(2.2). That's it!
#### Resetting a Password
If you've forgotten your password, click I FORGOT(2.3). You'll be brought to an extra question asking you for the email tied to this account(3). Ensure you enter your email **exactly as you entered it while registering!** Case sensitivity doesn't matter, but do try a couple different emails before throwing in the "i musta not entered an email" hat!

### Anonymous Registration
<img align="right" width="369" height="320" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/897051673556582420/registeranon.png">

While impeded by several limitations, "anonymous" accounts are integral to TETR.IO's original concept of being "about as easy to join as a standard .IO game". They're also normally exempt from [the alt policy](https://tetr.io/about/rules/#ap), so you could have an secondary anonymous account as a registered user for controller play, for instance. All you need to make one is a *single* click on the JOIN button, if you don't mind having a non-descriptive username. Anonymous accounts *can* have customized usernames however, provided the username isn't already used by a registered account:

1. Simply enter a username(1.1) into the prompt you see while not logged into <https://tetr.io/>(1), then click JOIN(1.2).
2. **If the username you chose is already in use,** you'll be prompted for whoever owns that account's password(2). Please proceed to back out of this login attempt(2.1).
3. If the chosen username is free, simply click STAY ANONYMOUS to keep the username in an anonymous state(3)!

## Profile Pictures
Registered TETR.IO user accounts may set their profile pictures for free from the relevant account settings category. The attached video shows you how to access this category, available from the ingame CONFIG option:

</p>

### My Profile Picture Isn't NSFW!
TETR.IO profile picture and banner uploads are automatically scrutinized, in accordance with [rule 8](https://tetr.io/about/rules/#r8/), by an open source library, which in turn is powered by machine learning. The specific names of these projects are [nsfwjs](https://github.com/infinitered/nsfwjs) and [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), both of which are listed at the very top of [TETR.IO's open source acknowledgements](https://tetr.io/about/acknowledgements/). This means, at times, the automated detection process can incur a false-positive and deny you your rights to upload your otherwise safe for work imagery. There are ways around this system, but to disclose them here would be to make that information more accessible to bad actors. **Just try another image.**
Also see(from https://nsfwjs.com/):
> Humans are amazing at visual identification. NSFW tries to error more on the side of things being dirty than clean. It's part of what makes failures on NSFW JS entertaining as well as practical.

*(although do note if you decide to use the interactive checker included in this site, it may be several more revisions up-to-date compared to TETR.IO's checking)*

## Reporting a TETR.IO User
<img align="right" width="335" height="114" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813901028394795078/894379053367304222/unknown.png">

If you would like to report any TETR.IO user for breaking [the TETR.IO Community Rules](https://tetr.io/about/rules/), please use the ingame reporting systems instead of, say, public Discord channels!

As a registered user, simply click on a suspicious, rude, or otherwise problematic user's username or usercard, or, type said user's username into the ingame TETRA CHANNEL's search bar, accessible by clicking the *third* menu option, to access their "profile card". Once this card is open, simply click this arrow, and then click this report icon to begin the guided process of including details. If you report while in a room, chat logs will be automatically included. 

### Appealing an ingame ban/Getting "support"

**DO NOT APPEAL BANS IN THE TETR.IO DISCORD!** Your message will be ignored at best.

- To contact TETR.IO support regarding an issue with your account, visit https://tetr.io/about/support/ and follow the instructions.
- For live technical help, feel free to ask in [the #tetrio channel](https://discord.com/channels/673303546107658242/674421736162197515), where someone may be able to help you. 
    - Please only do this **after** skimming [the FAQ topics](../Home), however!
- If you have an issue report or a feature request, use their respective channels in [the Discord server](https://l.tetr.io/discord), or open an issue at [the TETR.IO Issue Tracker](https://github.com/tetrio/issues/issues/new/choose).

## Tiers of Supporter

[TETR.IO Supporter](https://l.tetr.io) tiers are determined by your amount of **total** support - including purchases for yourself, gifts you've sent to other players, and any Patreon support from the old supporter system. You can check this number by going to CONFIG > ACCOUNT.

The cutoffs for each supporter tier are as follows:

  -  ★ (tier 2) - 20€
  -  ★★ (tier 3) - 80€
  -  ★★★ (tier 4) - 250€

Once you've achieved a supporter tier, you keep it forever. If your supporter expires, the supporter tier badge and name colour will be hidden, but will be reactivated if you purchase (or are gifted) more supporter. Furthermore, your name will be permanently listed in the game's credits when you reach 200€ of total support. Unlike other supporter benefits, this will remain even if your supporter expires.

## Who gets verified?
TETR.IO verification may be conferred for a variety of reasons — in general, staff verifies TETR.IO staff members (such as [OSK, developer of TETR.IO](https://ch.tetr.io/u/osk)), users who have obtained the Contributor role in the official TETR.IO Discord server (such as [UNIQMG, author of the TETR.IO PLUS modification](https://ch.tetr.io/u/uniqmg)), players who have obtained world-class achievements (such as [former 40L WR holder VINCEHD](https://ch.tetr.io/u/vincehd)), and individuals who have demonstrated major influence in the community (such as [CABOOZLED_PIE, host of the Underdogs Cup tournament series](https://ch.tetr.io/u/caboozled_pie)).

Additionally, there are edge cases where notable individuals outside of the TETR.IO community (such as [BTMC, well known osu! streamer](https://ch.tetr.io/u/btmc)) may be verified, although this, along with all requests for verification, is considered on a case by case basis.

# Custom Assets
Looking to add your own backgrounds/skins to the game? Here's how to do it!

## Built-in Backgrounds
**Q:** How do I set a custom background?

**A:** Assuming you have a local file on your computer you'd like to use, just upload that file to **[catbox.moe](https://catbox.moe/)**. As of writing, it's free for use and simply works with TETR.IO's CORS header-requirements. 

### Troubleshooting
If your image is already hosted on the net*(Catbox included)*, and you have a *(nonfunctional ingame)* link to use with TETR.IO's ingame background option, consider debugging that link with [this interactive checker](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrio/backgrounds/).
If this site is showing that the link *should work*, please proceed to hard-reload the game with **CTRL+F5** *(yes, even on the desktop client)*. After this point, navigate into a SOLO 40 LINES match to confirm the background loading.

## Custom Skins
**Q:** Where do you get custom skins from?

**A:** Custom blockskins are generally discovered through the
* [you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus](https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus/) repository of skins
* [Curated gallery on Tenchi's site](https://tetrio.team2xh.net/?t=skins)
* [Jstris Customization Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xO8DTORacMmSJAQicpJscob7WUkOVuaNH0wzkR_X194/edit#gid=1212216734)
* As all outlined in [this wiki page dedicated to finding content](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/finding-content)

You'll want to load these with the third party TETR.IO PLUS addon, exclusive to [the TETR.IO Desktop app](https://tetr.io/about/desktop/) or the Firefox web browser.

TETR.IO PLUS's project page, as well as **downloads for the modification**, may be found [here](https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/home "TETR.IO PLUS's GitLab repository's wiki").

# Stock Assets
Interested in getting a copy of TETR.IO's default assets? Here's where you get that!

## Music

*TETR.IO's* soundtrack is currently entirely provided by various musicians under the royalty free [*HURT RECORD* label](<https://www.hurtrecord.com/>) -- that is to say, each soundtrack *should* be stream-safe, provided you show the onscreen watermark centered near the bottom, displaying the currently playing 
song during the very start of gameplay. *Refer to [HURT RECORD's terms of service](https://www.hurtrecord.com/about/terms.html) for specific terms of use.*

Interested in listening to or downloading the soundtrack for personal use? There's [a YouTube mirror here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFmyK0hSlVD_a98eL1BcGMOTblz8kQ0h) as well as [an up-to-date Google Sheets list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_tpfLo_qUfNG2vQG3uqQ5fbjT01VefZVgB7RH2lOzM/edit), *both provided by EricICX.*

## Fonts
<img align="right" width="378" height="375" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/674421736162197515/914184675071770664/unknown.png">

Here's a list of all of TETR.IO's fonts, as well as where you can download them and install them. Just right click these files in the File Explorer to do that.
* HUN-din: https://tetr.io/res/font/hun2.ttf?v=9
* ProFontWindows: https://tetr.io/res/font/pfw.ttf
* Config: https://tetr.io/res/font/cr.ttf: 
* Franklin Gothic already comes with Windows, though you're specifically looking for Franklin Gothic Medium

## Sound Effects
All of TETR.IO's sound effects are stored in a single "sound effect atlas" found [here](https://tetr.io/sfx/tetrio.ogg). There's an issue with this file though; all sound effects are split only by time and not by file names, so it's likely this file isn't the one you want. If you would like a copy of all of the TETR.IO sounds split up, *albeit with an ever so slightly lower quality,* please download [this `.zip` file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/919778936475508776/tetrio-sound-effects.zip), sourced from [UniQMG](https://you.have.fail/ed/ "UniQMG's homepage")'s ["sound effects extractor"](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2032731).

## Backgrounds
The backgrounds, similar to TETR.IO's music, is all royalty free and hails from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). You can likely get extremely similar photographs for free here and use them as your background in TETR.IO itself, if the stock ones are getting tiresome.

If you just wanted to download the default backgrounds, check out [this Google Sheets list, created by @booyah#6473](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uSNuUEFBQz6vCHOxR4gWRshWM5KQ4ZvH0xWjtMz4Yg/edit), which covers backgrounds from three phases of TETR.IO's lifespan so far!
