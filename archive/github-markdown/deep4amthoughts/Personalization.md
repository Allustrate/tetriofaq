TETR.IO verification may be conferred for a variety of reasons â€” in general, staff verifies TETR.IO staff members (such as [OSK, developer of TETR.IO](https://ch.tetr.io/u/osk)), users who have obtained the Contributor role in the official TETR.IO Discord server (such as [UNIQMG, author of the TETR.IO PLUS modification](https://ch.tetr.io/u/uniqmg)), players who have obtained world-class achievements (such as [former 40L WR holder VINCEHD](https://ch.tetr.io/u/vincehd)), and individuals who have demonstrated major influence in the community (such as [CABOOZLED_PIE, host of the Underdogs Cup tournament series](https://ch.tetr.io/u/caboozled_pie)).

Additionally, there are edge cases where notable individuals outside of the TETR.IO community (such as [BTMC, well known osu! streamer](https://ch.tetr.io/u/btmc)) may be verified, although this, along with all other requests for verification, is considered on a case by case basis.
