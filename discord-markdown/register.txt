How-to create a registered TETR.IO account, starting from nothing

Welcome to TETR.IO! While you can play with a far less involved "anonymous" account,(see .faq registeranon for details) a fully registered account is your only ticket into the TETRA LEAGUE, saved 40 LINES and BLITZ records, access to a customizable profile card and userpage(such as profile pictures: refer to .faq pfp), and more!

**__To create a TETR.IO account__**, first, navigate to <https://tetr.io/>. You will be greeted with the registration dialog immediately, provided you aren't already logged in(1). From here, enter your chosen username(1.1) and click the JOIN button(1.2). 
**If the username is taken, you will be prompted for its password(2)**: in this case, back out and choose another username(2.1). 
If the username is unoccupied, you will be prompted to either "STAY ANONYMOUS" or "REGISTER"(3). 
After selecting REGISTER, you will be asked to supply an optional email, as well as the password you will lock your account with(4).

Please note that you are only allowed one registered account as per the alt policy found at <https://tetr.io/about/rules/>! Choose your name wisely: future name changes are only available with the purchase of TETR.IO supporter.
