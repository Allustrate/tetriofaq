How-to report specific users for violating the TETR.IO community rules or terms of service

If you would like to report a TETR.IO user, please use the ingame reporting systems instead of public Discord channels! As a registered user, simply click on a suspicious, rude, or otherwise problematic user's username, or, type said user's username into the ingame TETRA CHANNEL's search bar, accessible by clicking the *third* menu option, to access their profile card. Once this card is open, simply click this arrow, which points to the left, and then click this report icon to begin the guided process of including details. If you report while in a room, chat logs will be automatically included. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/813901028394795078/894379053367304222/unknown.png

If you would like to report an urgent TETR.IO Discord incident, such as Discord Nitro spambots, or sudden offensive raids, proceed to immediately ping the <@&728007233043955883> role. If you would like to report a specific user for more subtle reasons, consider direct messaging a member who dons the <@&674420220261040148> role!
