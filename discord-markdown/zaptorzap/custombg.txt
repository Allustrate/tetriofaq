**Q:** How do I set a custom background?

**A:** Assuming you have a local file on your computer you'd like to use, just upload that file to **https://catbox.moe/**. As of writing, it's free for use and simply works with TETR.IO's CORS header-requirements. https://files.catbox.moe/65j4a2.png
*__--Troubleshooting--__*
If your image is already hosted on the net*(Catbox included)*, and you have a *(nonfunctional ingame)* link to use with TETR.IO's ingame background option, consider debugging that link with this interactive checker: __https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrio/backgrounds/__
If this site is showing that the link *should work*, please proceed to hard-reload the game with **CTRL+F5** *(yes, even on the desktop client)*. After this point, navigate into a SOLO 40 LINES match to confirm the background loading.
