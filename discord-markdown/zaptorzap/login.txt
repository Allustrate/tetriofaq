How-to log into your registered TETR.IO account

Logging into your registered account is easy, if not slightly obscure. The registration form doubles as a login questionnaire, so, if you know your username and password, just follow these steps!

When prompted to "ENTER A USERNAME TO JOIN"(1), enter in your registered account's username(1.1) and choose JOIN(1.2).
You'll see a section(2) asking for your password at this stage(2.1), enter that in and click LOGIN(2.2). That's it!
----
If you've forgotten your password, click I FORGOT(2.3). You'll be brought to an extra question asking you for the email tied to this account(3). Ensure you enter your email **exactly as you entered it while registering!** Capitalization matters, so try a couple different case-types before throwing in the "i musta not entered an email" hat! (`Mixed@Case.Com`, `ALL@CAPS.ORG`, etc. `lower@case.io` and `LoWeR@CaSe.Io` are parsed as different emails, *even if* they lead to the same inbox)
