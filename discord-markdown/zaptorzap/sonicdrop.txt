How-to choose a higher SDF value, allowing you to soft drop like the pros!

To execute a "hard drop without placing the piece", such as those extremely fast T-Spins, turn this slider in the CONFIG to ♾️! Then, use your soft drop key as normal: the piece will rocket down to the bottom instantly now! If you're interested in the other handling values, please refer to FAQ entries `ARR`,`DAS`,`DCD`, and `SDF`
