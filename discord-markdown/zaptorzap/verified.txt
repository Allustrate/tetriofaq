TETR.IO verification may be conferred for a variety of reasons â€” in general, staff verifies TETR.IO staff members (such as OSK, developer of TETR.IO), users who have obtained the Contributor role in the official TETR.IO Discord server (such as UNIQMG, author of the TETR.IO PLUS modification), players who have obtained world-class achievements (such as former 40L WR holder VINCEHD_), and individuals who have demonstrated major influence in the community (such as CABOOZLED_PIE, host of the Underdogs Cup tournament series).

Additionally, there are edge cases where notable individuals outside of the TETR.IO community (such as BTMC) may be verified, although this is considered on a case by case basis.
