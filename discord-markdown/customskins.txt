**Q:** Where do you get custom skins from?

**A:** Custom blockskins are generally discovered through https://you.have.fail/ed/at/tetrioplus/#, although, you'll want to load them with the third party TETR.IO PLUS addon, exclusive to the Desktop app(https://tetr.io/about/desktop/) or the Firefox web browser.

TETR.IO PLUS's project page, as well as __downloads for the modification__, may be found here: https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/wikis/home
